                technology slump in decades, and the most controversial merger in high-tech history. Yet just as things
                were about to turn around, she was abruptly fired, making front-page news around the world.Carly Fiorina
                was president and CEO of Hewlett-Packard from 1999 to 2005, and chairman from 2000 to 2005. Before
                joining HP, she spent nearly twenty years at AT&T and Lucent Technologies, where she held a number of
                senior leadership positions. She has a B.A. in medieval history and philosophy from Stanford University,
                an M.B.A. from the University of Maryland, and an M.S. in business from MIT’s Sloan School.
